Learning Progress Tracker

- Stage 1: Setup the core of your program: read input, detect a pre.defined set of commans, and responde accordingly.
- Stage 2: Verify new users by checking their registration information. In this stafe, your program should read information about users form the console and verify that it matches certain patterns.
- Stage 3:This time, we will add users to the data store and update their records as the new learning data becomes available. 
  - Check if the provided email has been already used when adding information about students. If so, respond with the following message: This email is already taken.
  - Recognize the new list command to print the Students: a header followed by the student IDs. The students must be listed in the order they were added. Remember, each ID must be unique. If there are no students to list, print No students found.
  - Recognize the new add points and print the following message in response: Enter an id and points or 'back' to return. After that, the program must read learning progress data in the following format: studentId number number number number. The numbers correspond to the courses (Java, DSA, Databases, Spring). Number is a non-negative integer number. If there is no student with the specified ID, the program should print No student is found for id=%s. where %s is the invalid ID. Also, if any of the numbers are missing, or there is an extra number or any of the numbers do not meet the requirements mentioned above, the program should print Incorrect points format. If the learning progress data is entered in the correct format, and the specified user exists, the program should update the student's record and print Points updated. Once back is entered, the program must stop reading learning progress data.
  - Recognize the find command and print the following message: Enter an id or 'back' to return. After that, if an ID is entered, the program should either print details of the student with the specified ID in this format: id points: Java=%d; DSA=%d; Databases=%d; Spring=%dwhere %d is the respective number of points earned by the student. If the ID cannot be found, print the error message: No student is found for id=%s. where %s is the invalid ID.
